# Expenses-Tracker
## What is this?
This is a really basic expenses tracker, based from [Brad Traversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy/vanillawebprojects/tree/master/expense-tracker) javascript's version.
### Why this?
This is a project with real-world application that I can expand as I go and and still practice React's basics (*cof cof* and just something upload to github *cof cof*)
### TODO List
 - *yet* Better implementation of animations
 - ~~Better~~ Different HTML/CSS
 - Expenses divided by month
 - External Data Storage (and/or) back-end
 - Login/User Auth
 - Probably some other stuff

 #### What I done already
  - Convert to React
  - Some animations
  - Expense description
  ## Note
  This is a really bad readme and I'm aware of that, but for the foreseeable future I intend to keep working on this project and update/add as I go.
