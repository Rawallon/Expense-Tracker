# Expenses-Tracker
## What is this?
This is a really basic expenses tracker, based from [Brad Traversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy/vanillawebprojects/tree/master/expense-tracker) javascript's version.
### Why this?
This is a project with real-world application that I can expand as I go and and still practice React's basics (*cof cof* and just something upload to github *cof cof*)
### TODO List
 - Better (implementation of) animations
 - Different HTML/CSS
 - Expenses divided by month
 - External Data Storage (and/or) back-end
 - Login/User Auth
 - Probably some other stuff
